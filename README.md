# QPSK-Receiver-Design-with-Carrier-and-Timing-Synchronization-MATLAB-Link-Level-Simulation-
QPSK receiver link-level simulation with carrier and timing synchronization. Implements CFO estimation via squared-preamble DFT comb, interpolating Early–Late timing recovery, matched filtering, and residual phase tracking. Evaluated with Monte-Carlo SER vs Eb/N0 under clock and carrier offsets.
